Will the following class compile? If not, why?

public class Singleton<T> {
  public static T getInstance() {
	if (instance == null)
  	instance = new Singleton<T>();
	return instance;
  }
  private static T instance = null;
}

//It won't compile because the static field isn't allowed to be added to Parameter T
